# GuessingGame-JavaScript

Write an application using C# to implement the game, based on the following steps:

1. The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their guess.
3. The computer then tells the user if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly.
